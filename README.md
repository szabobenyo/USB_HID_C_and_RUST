# USB HID on *STM32F412ZG* + RUST
Hello my name is Bence and I'm a trainee at BALLUFF Electronics Ltd. <br />
My current task is to set up this microcontroller as a Custom USB Human Interface Device, and call my own RUST functions from a CubeMX generated C code.<br />

You can find tutorials(ENG/HUN), debug and release WindowsFormApps in the utils folder.
